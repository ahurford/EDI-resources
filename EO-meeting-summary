# Surveying participant diversity
- ethical obligation to explain what will be done with the data
- will be time-consuming to acquire reference data (i.e. Stat CAN has information of PhD awardees and labour market information)
- reference group data limitations will restrict meaningfulness of conclusions
- plan for data storage needed, limit those with access
- data cannot be reported so as to be identifiable; do not allow linkages; release small group information only when, say, 10 respondents have been accumulated.
- serves accountability purpose; bigger contribution might be made spending time elsewhere

# Awards
- Accomodations for gaps
- Ask judges to watch an unconscious bias video (tricouncil)
- State we encourage applications from diverse groups

# Venue to bring concerns
- just generally say on website to email with concerns. We are not in a legal position to handle compliants, universities are better equipped.

# Prepared statements
- Groups directly involved will prepare their own statements
- It can be constructive to refer to their prepared statements to center these groups and support their initiatives.
- Canadian Center for Diversity and Inclusion prepares resouces for universities.
- Free app "whose land" for land acknowledgements

# Workshops
- Tricouncil has resources, particularly for evaluating CRC program
- Few people will feel qualified to give workshops. Qualified individuals over-burdened.
- CAIMS role could be to make a bank of resources and ask individuals if they would be willing to educate themselves on a topic and then give a workshop.
- Recommendations for keynotes from Provost in EDI.
- PD on how to write diversity statements for grants

# Other
- Have conversations about implicit bias
- Resource: Canadian association for prevention of discrimination in higher education
- Say that accomodations can be provided.
- Ask for questions in chat box (minizmize poor connectivity issues)
