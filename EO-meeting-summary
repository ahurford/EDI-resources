# Surveying participant diversity
- ethical obligation to explain what will be done with the data
- will be time-consuming to acquire reference data (i.e. Stat CAN has information of PhD awardees and labour market information)
- reference group data limitations will restrict meaningfulness of conclusions
- plan for data storage needed, limit those with 
- data cannot be reported so as to be identifiable; do not allow linkages; release small group information only when, say, 10 respondents have been accumulated.

# Awards
- Accomodations for gaps
- Ask judges to watch an unconscious bias video

# Venue to bring concerns
- just generally say on website to email with concerns. We are not in a legal position to handle compliants, universities are better equipped.

# Prepared statements
- Groups directly involved will prepare their own statements and it can be constructive to refer to their prepared statements to center these groups and support their initiatives.
- Canadian Center for Diversity and Inclusion prepares resouces for universities.

- Tricouncil has resources
- Few people will feel qualified to give workshops. CAIMS role could be to make a bank of resources and ask individuals if they would be willing to educate themselves on topic and then give a workshop.
