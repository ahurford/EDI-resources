Long story short, I have five children, aged 8 and under. Two of them were born before my PhD, two of them were born during my PhD and my youngest was born during my postdoc. It is not hard to imagine why when talking about ‘work-life balance’ I find it difficult to unambiguously identify my ‘work’ and my ‘life’, and if being a balanced person means flawless rationality and stability, then I am probably not one, as I never sat down to reflect thoughtfully about what it could have meant to take care of such a large family while simultaneously starting my career.

After my masters, I just knew that I was ready to have children, and once I did, I realized that I wanted to study too, so I went back to academia, where I felt I belonged. Eventually, I had more children, but I kept walking my way through comprehensive and candidacy exams, and, at the same time, through hours of diapers change and baby talks. I held on to my two passions, blaming myself for not having been able to let one or the other go, and fearing the judgments of colleagues and of other parents. Till one day I eventually realized that my successes at work and at home were indeed due to the fact that I did have a work and a life to balance, meaning that something in what I was doing was exactly right.

Having two passions doesn’t mean twice the load. I couldn’t have had children without a stimulating job that brings me realization and satisfaction at a personal level. I couldn’t be so creative and committed to my work without my family’s positive energy to strike me when I am lost in front of the computer screen.
Having a successful academic career while raising a family, or while cultivating other hobbies and interests, is not only possible, it is endorsed. Here is how to make sure that your research will benefit from a happy and gratifying personal life, and viceversa.


## Wear unmatched socks

To manage home and work load, I wear unmatched socks; the reason being that I do not want to spend half an hour of my day trying to sort out the mess of colourful socks that remains on the bottom of my laundry basket. What I mean to say is that time is finite, and investing more hours in data analysis and baby feeding will inevitably mean having less time for other activities. To me, it didn’t need to be a sacrifice.

Know what is important for you, and give up something else first. It just needs a bit of reorganization. Eat out, sometimes, or have your groceries home delivered. Go to work and take your child to school by bike, to exercise, be with your kids, and meet professional expectations at the same time. Think about your research while cleaning the floor, while washing dishes, while pushing your kid on the swing, and value the forced breaks from work that caring for your family requires you to take. Use them to get that change in perspective you would never have experienced by sitting at your desk.

And if you burn your dinner from time to time, because you are trying to listen to your children, mentally check your lab results, and decide how much salt to put in the sauce, all at the same time, don’t take it too bad! It happens to all of us.

## Enjoy your Fridays.. and enjoy your Mondays

Just because one can think everywhere, and at all times, it doesn’t mean that one needs to do it. Close your laptop and spend some quality time with your family and friends on weekends or on special days. When at work, and your children are safely in the hands of somebody you trust, be focused, and efficient, and appreciate the time you have got for yourself, and for fulfilling your personal goals. I feel excited about taking the weekend off on Fridays, as much as I like to restart my morning routine on Mondays. I don’t restrict myself to a tight daily schedule, but I set up some achievable weekly goals, and I trust myself in being able to accomplish them. During the week I work whenever I have time, at day, or at night, to complete what I planned, such that I can take time off, to be present for my family, when the opportunity comes.

## Love the process, not the result

If you are a passionate cyclist, you may have some destinations in mind, but what you love is the road itself, with its uphills, downhills, and flat stretches. You wouldn’t be cycling if you were only interested in your arrival point. Similarly, you don’t choose to do research just because one day you may be writing a very impactful paper that will revolutionize your discipline. If you love your job, you like the process of looking up research questions, collecting data, and choosing the colour of your graphs (maybe, with your child’s help). Eventually, you may publish your work, but it may be the same day that your two-years-old child decides to open the fridge and break all the eggs on the kitchen floor. You will have good moments, and bad moments, and flat and boring moments too. Do your best, and keep pedaling. As long as you love what you are doing, you will enjoy your road, you will enjoy your story. And my story is made out of scientific papers and toddler books. Side by side.
